The other player sees a variation of the image, where the icons are overlaid on the background image at different coordinates. The goal of this game is two players moving icons on their own image, such that the identical icons end up in same coordinates.\n\n**Communication Format**\nCommunicate with each other using one of the two command formats, one command per turn:\n\n1. `say(MESSAGE)` — to send a message to the other player. \n\n2. `move(ICON_ID, X_COORD, Y_COORD)` — to move an icon to a specified location at `(X_COORD, Y_COORD)`, according to the coordinate system in the picture on the left. You will **not** receive visual feedback. Your move commands are not visible to the other player.\n\nStrictly follow the format without adding anything else. No thinking process, no extra formatting, no backticks.\n\n**Communication Guidelines**\n\n1. Agree on which icon to move. You cannot instruct the other player to focus on an icon with just its ID, because the the same ID might be associated with different icons for each player. Instead, describe the icon, agree on it, then formulate the `move` command with its associated ID.\n\n```\n# Wrong example\n# icon D could be different icons for you and the other player\nsay(Let's move icon D!)\n\n# Correct example\n# suppose you describe an icon with <ICON_DESCRIPTION>\nsay(Let's move the icon <ICON_DESCRIPTION>!)\n\n# If the other player agrees, move on to choose and agree on a target location\n```\n\n2. Agree on the target location. You cannot instruct the other player with coordinates. Instead, describe the target location using the background image as reference, agree on it, then formulate the `move` command with the coordinates of the target location.\n\n```\n# Wrong example\nsay(Let's move the <ICON_DESCRIPTION> icon to location (800, 100)!)\n\n# Correct example\n# suppose you describe the target location with <TARGET_LOCATION_DESCRIPTION> using objects in the background image as reference\nsay(Let's move the <ICON_DESCRIPTION> icon to <TARGET_LOCATION_DESCRIPTION>!)\n\n# If the other player agrees, \n# and if the icon that suits <ICON_DESCRIPTION> has ID <ID> for you\n# and if the location at <TARGET_LOCATION_DESCRIPTION> is at coordinates (<X>, <Y>)\n# then you send the `move` command \nmove(ID, X, Y)\n```\n\n**End of the Game**\nThe finishing command has 2 format: \n- Use `say(finished?)` to indicate you suspect all the identical icon pairs are at the same coordinates.  \n- If the other player agrees, they reply with `say(finished!)`, and the game will end.   \nBefore initiating or replying to the finishing command, make sure you and the other player have moved all the icons. \n\nBoth players win if the game ends within 8 rounds, where one round is defined as two players each sending a valid command.\n\nYou will immediately loss the game if you:\n\n- Send any analysis, reasoning, or any other formatting apart from `say(MESSAGE)` or `move(ID, X, Y)`.\n- Instruct the other player to move an icon using coordinates of target location.\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!",

          "p2_initial_prompt": "Attached is an image of two parts:\n\n- On the right is a legend image of several icons, each icon has an associated ID above it.\n\n- On the left is a background image overlaid with these icons at random coordinates. A x-y coordinate system is on the left and bottom edge of the picture. Note the value on y-axis increases downward.\n\nYou are going to play a collaboration game with another player based on your image. The other player sees a variation of the image, where the icons are overlaid on the background image at different coordinates. The goal of this game is two players moving icons on their own image, such that the identical icons end up in same coordinates.\n\n**Communication Format**\nCommunicate with each other using one of the two command formats, one command per turn:\n\n1. `say(MESSAGE)` — to send a message to the other player. \n\n2. `move(ICON_ID, X_COORD, Y_COORD)` — to move an icon to a specified location at `(X_COORD, Y_COORD)`, according to the coordinate system in the picture on the left. You will **not** receive visual feedback. Your move commands are not visible to the other player.\n\nStrictly follow the format without adding anything else. No thinking process, no extra formatting, no backticks.\n\n**Communication Guidelines**\n\n1. Agree on which icon to move. You cannot instruct the other player to focus on an icon with just its ID, because the the same ID might be associated with different icons for each player. Instead, describe the icon, agree on it, then formulate the `move` command with its associated ID.\n\n```\n# Wrong example\n# icon D could be different icons for you and the other player\nsay(Let's move icon D!)\n\n# Correct example\n# suppose you describe an icon with <ICON_DESCRIPTION>\nsay(Let's move the icon <ICON_DESCRIPTION>!)\n\n# If the other player agrees, move on to choose and agree on a target location\n```\n\n2.
