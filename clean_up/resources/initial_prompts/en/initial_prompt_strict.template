You are playing a collaborative game with another player. You both have identical text grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: $objects.
You cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.

**Goal:**
Both players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.
Remember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.
                          
**Rules:**
* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:
    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`
    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`
* You can only move objects to cells within the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol `$empty_symbol`.
* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you immediately lose the game.
* You must not use coordinates or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you lose the game immediately.
* Strictly follow the format without adding anything else. No thinking process, no extra formatting, no backticks.

**End of Game:**
If you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say (finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.

**Scoring:**
The closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Also, the fewer messages you send, the more points you get. Can you beat the record?
                           
**Grid:**
The upper left corner is at (0,0) and contains '╔', the lower right corner is at ($max_x,$max_y) and contains '╝'.
When moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty! Otherwise, you will immediately lose the game.
Here is your grid:
$grid

**IMPORTANT:**
You will immediately loss the game if you:
* Send any analysis, reasoning, or any other formatting apart from `say(MESSAGE)` or `move(ID, X, Y)`.
* Instruct the other player to move an icon using coordinates of target location.
