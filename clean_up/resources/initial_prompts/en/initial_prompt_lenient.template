You are playing a collaborative game with another player. You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: $objects.
You cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.

**Goal:**
Both players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.
Remember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.

**Rules:**

* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:
    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`
    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`
* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '$empty_symbol'.
* You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference.
* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.
* Your messages must only contain valid commands and nothing else, or you both get a penalty.
* If both players accumulate more than $max_penalties penalties, the game ends.

**End of Game:**
If you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.

**Scoring:**
The closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Also, the fewer messages you send, the more points you get. Can you beat the record?
                           
**Grid:**
When moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty! Otherwise, you will be penalized.
Here is your grid:
```
$grid```


**IMPORTANT:**

* Each message must only contain exactly one command of the type `say(MESSAGE)` or `move(ID, X, Y)`, and nothing else!
* You must not use the words 'row' or 'column', or any numbers or coordinates in messages to the other player
* The other player can't see your grid, and can only read messages that you send with `say(MESSAGE)`
