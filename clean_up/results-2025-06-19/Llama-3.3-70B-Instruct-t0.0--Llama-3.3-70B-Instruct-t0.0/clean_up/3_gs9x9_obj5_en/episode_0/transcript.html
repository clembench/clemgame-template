        <p><p>You are playing a collaborative game with another player. You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'C', 'H', 'I', 'T', 'W'.</p>
<p>You cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong>
Both players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.
Remember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:<ul>
<li>Send a message to the other player: <code>say(&lt;message&gt;)</code></li>
<li>Move an object to a new position: <code>move(&lt;object&gt;,&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;)</code></li>
<li>If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!</li>
<li>If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communicating with the other player</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The <em>only</em> way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the <code>say(MESSAGE)</code> command!<ul>
<li>For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as <code>say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)</code></li>
<li>Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Moving Objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.</li>
<li>For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: </li>
</ul>
<pre><code>    123
   ╔═╤═╗
 1 ║◌│◌║
 2 ╟─┘C║
 3 ║◌◌◌║
   ╚═══╝
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>In this example, the top left corner is at <code>(1,1)</code>, the top right corner is at <code>(3,1)</code>, the bottom left corner at <code>(1,3)</code> and the bottom right corner is at <code>(3,3)</code>.</li>
<li>If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: <code>move(C,1,1)</code>. The resulting grid would look like this: </li>
</ul>
<pre><code>    123
   ╔═╤═╗
 1 ║C│◌║
 2 ╟─┘◌║
 3 ║◌◌◌║
   ╚═══╝
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>However, if you try <code>move(C,2,1)</code>, you will be penalized, since the spot <code>(2,1)</code> is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.</li>
<li>Similarly, if you try <code>move(C,2,2)</code>, you will be penalized, since the spot <code>(2,2)</code> is already occupied by '┘'.</li>
<li>Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!</li>
<li>If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End of Game:</strong>
If you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending <code>say(finished?)</code>. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply <code>say(finished!)</code>, the game will end.</p>
<p><strong>Scoring:</strong>
The closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?</p>
<p><strong>Grid:</strong>
When moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty! Otherwise, you will be penalized.
Here is your grid:</p>
<pre><code>    1234567

 7 ║◌I◌◌◌◌◌║
   ╚═══════╝

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each message must only contain exactly one command of the type <code>say(MESSAGE)</code> or <code>move(ID, X, Y)</code>, and nothing else!</li>
<li>You must not use the words 'row' or 'column', or any numbers or coordinates in messages to the other player</li>
<li>The other player can't see your grid, and the only way you can communicate with them is by using the command <code>say(MESSAGE)</code>!</li>
</ul>
