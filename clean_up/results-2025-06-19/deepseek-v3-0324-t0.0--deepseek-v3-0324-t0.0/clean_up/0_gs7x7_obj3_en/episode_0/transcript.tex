	 You are playing a collaborative game with another player. You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'C', 'L', 'P'.\\ \tt \\ \tt You cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Goal:**\\ \tt Both players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\\ \tt Remember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Rules:**\\ \tt \\ \tt * In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\\ \tt     * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\\ \tt     * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\\ \tt     * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\\ \tt     * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Communicating with the other player**\\ \tt \\ \tt * It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\\ \tt     * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)`\\ \tt     * Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!\\ \tt * You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Moving Objects**\\ \tt \\ \tt * You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\\ \tt * For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \\ \tt \\ \tt ```\\ \tt     123\\ \tt    ╔═╤═╗\\ \tt  1 ║◌│◌║\\ \tt  2 ╟─┘C║\\ \tt  3 ║◌◌◌║\\ \tt    ╚═══╝\\ \tt ```\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt * In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\\ \tt * If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt ```\\ \tt     123\\ \tt    ╔═╤═╗\\ \tt  1 ║C│◌║\\ \tt  2 ╟─┘◌║\\ \tt  3 ║◌◌◌║\\ \tt    ╚═══╝\\ \tt ```\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt * However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\\ \tt * Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\\ \tt * Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\\ \tt * If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt **End of Game:**\\ \tt If you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Scoring:**\\ \tt The closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\\ \tt                            \\ \tt **Grid:**\\ \tt When moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty! Otherwise, you will be penalized.\\ \tt Here is your grid:\\ \tt ```\\ \tt     12345\\ \tt    ╔═══╤═╗\\ \tt  1 ║P◌◌│◌║\\ \tt  2 ║C◌L│◌║\\ \tt  3 ║◌┌─┘◌║\\ \tt  4 ║◌│◌◌◌║\\ \tt  5 ║◌│◌◌◌║\\ \tt    ╚═╧═══╝\\ \tt ```\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt **IMPORTANT:**\\ \tt \\ \tt * Each message must only contain exactly one command of the type `say(MESSAGE)` or `move(ID, X, Y)`, and nothing else!\\ \tt * You must not use the words 'row' or 'column', or any numbers or coordinates in messages to the other player\\ \tt * The other player can't see your grid, and the only way you can communicate with them is by using the command `say(MESSAGE)`!\\ \tt \\ \tt Please send a message to the other player to start the game!
