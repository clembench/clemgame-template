You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'D', 'U', 'M', 'B'.\n\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n    * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\n    * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**Communicating with the other player**\n\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\n    * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)`\n    * Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!\n* You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty!

You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'D', 'U', 'M', 'B'.\n\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n    * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\n    * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**Communicating with the other player**\n\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\n    * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner.

If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`.

The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty!

The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty!

You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'D', 'U', 'M', 'B'.\n\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n    * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\n    * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**Communicating with the other player**\n\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\n    * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)`\n    * Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!\n* You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty!

You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'D', 'U', 'M', 'B'.\n\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n    * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\n    * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**Communicating with the other player**\n\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\n    * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)`\n    * Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!\n* You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty! Otherwise, you will be penalized.\nHere is your grid:\n```\n    12345\n   ╔═══╤═╗\n 1 ║UD◌│◌║\n 2 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n 3 ║◌B◌│◌║\n 4 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n 5 ║M◌◌│◌║\n   ╚═══╧═╝\n```\n\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\n* Each message must only contain exactly one command of the type `say(MESSAGE)` or `move(ID, X, Y)`, and nothing else!\n* You must not use the words 'row' or 'column', or any numbers or coordinates in messages to the other player\n* The other player can't see your grid, and the only way you can communicate with them is by using the command `say(MESSAGE)`!\n\nThe other player started the game by sending this message:\n\n\"Hello!

You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'D', 'U', 'M', 'B'.\n\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n    * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\n    * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**Communicating with the other player**\n\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\n    * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)`\n    * Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!\n* You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty! Otherwise, you will be penalized.\nHere is your grid:\n```\n    12345\n   ╔═══╤═╗\n 1 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n 2 ║B◌◌│◌║\n 3 ║D◌◌│M║\n 4 ║◌◌U│◌║\n 5 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n   ╚═══╧═╝\n```\n\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\n* Each message must only contain exactly one command of the type `say(MESSAGE)` or `move(ID, X, Y)`, and nothing else!\n* You must not use the words 'row' or 'column', or any numbers or coordinates in messages to the other player\n* The other player can't see your grid, and the only way you can communicate with them is by using the command `say(MESSAGE)`!\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "say(Hello!

You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'D', 'U', 'M', 'B'.\n\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n    * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\n    * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**Communicating with the other player**\n\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\n    * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)`\n    * Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!\n* You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty!

You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'D', 'U', 'M', 'B'.\n\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n    * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\n    * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**Communicating with the other player**\n\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\n    * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)`\n    * Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!\n* You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty! Otherwise, you will be penalized.\nHere is your grid:\n```\n    12345\n   ╔═══╤═╗\n 1 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n 2 ║B◌◌│◌║\n 3 ║D◌◌│M║\n 4 ║◌◌U│◌║\n 5 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n   ╚═══╧═╝\n```\n\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\n* Each message must only contain exactly one command of the type `say(MESSAGE)` or `move(ID, X, Y)`, and nothing else!\n* You must not use the words 'row' or 'column', or any numbers or coordinates in messages to the other player\n* The other player can't see your grid, and the only way you can communicate with them is by using the command `say(MESSAGE)`!\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "say(Hello!

You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'D', 'U', 'M', 'B'.\n\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n    * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\n    * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**Communicating with the other player**\n\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\n    * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)`\n    * Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!\n* You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty! Otherwise, you will be penalized.\nHere is your grid:\n```\n    12345\n   ╔═══╤═╗\n 1 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n 2 ║B◌◌│◌║\n 3 ║D◌◌│M║\n 4 ║◌◌U│◌║\n 5 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n   ╚═══╧═╝\n```\n\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\n* Each message must only contain exactly one command of the type `say(MESSAGE)` or `move(ID, X, Y)`, and nothing else!\n* You must not use the words 'row' or 'column', or any numbers or coordinates in messages to the other player\n* The other player can't see your grid, and the only way you can communicate with them is by using the command `say(MESSAGE)`!\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "say(Hello!

You both have identical grids, and the following objects are randomly placed on each grid: 'D', 'U', 'M', 'B'.\n\nYou cannot see the other player's grid, and they cannot see yours.\n\n**Goal:**\nBoth players need to move their objects on the grid in such a way that in the end both grids look the same.\nRemember that you can only see your own grid! You have to communicate with the other player to agree upon a common goal state.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* In each turn, you can send exactly one command. Valid commands are:\n    * Send a message to the other player: `say(<message>)`\n    * Move an object to a new position: `move(<object>,<x>,<y>)`\n    * If you use any other format, or send several commands at once, you will be penalized!\n    * If both players accumulate more than 10 penalties, the game ends.\n\n**Communicating with the other player**\n\n* It is vital that you communicate with the other player regarding your goal state! For example, it might be a good idea to agree on moving one object at a time. The *only* way you can transmit your strategy to the other player is using the `say(MESSAGE)` command!\n    * For example, if you want to move the object 'W' to the lower right corner, you could send a message such as `say(Let's move 'W' to the lower right corner. Do you agree?)`\n    * Make sure that you have agreed with the other player before you move any object!\n* You must not use the words 'row', 'column', coordinates, or numbers of any form when communicating with the other player. If you do, you get a penalty. Instead, use the shapes you see in the grid as reference, such as 'the bottom left corner', 'the larger empty rectangle in the lower center', etc.\n\n**Moving Objects**\n\n* You can only move objects to cells with in the bounds of the grid. The target cell must be empty, i.e., it must only contain the symbol '◌'.\n* For example, imagine you have a grid that looks like this: \n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║◌│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘C║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* In this example, the top left corner is at `(1,1)`, the top right corner is at `(3,1)`, the bottom left corner at `(1,3)` and the bottom right corner is at `(3,3)`.\n* If you have agreed with the other player to move 'C' to the top left corner, you can do this with the following command: `move(C,1,1)`. The resulting grid would look like this: \n\n\n```\n    123\n   ╔═╤═╗\n 1 ║C│◌║\n 2 ╟─┘◌║\n 3 ║◌◌◌║\n   ╚═══╝\n```\n\n\n* However, if you try `move(C,2,1)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,1)` is already occupied by the vertical line '│'.\n* Similarly, if you try `move(C,2,2)`, you will be penalized, since the spot `(2,2)` is already occupied by '┘'.\n* Before making a move, double check that the target spot is empty, and does not hold any letter, frame, or line!\n* If you try to move an object to a spot that is not empty, or try to move it outside of the grid, you will be penalized and can try again.\n\n\n**End of Game:**\nIf you think you reached the goal, you can ask the other player to finish the game by sending `say(finished?)`. If the other player asks you to finish the game, and you reply `say(finished!)`, the game will end.\n\n**Scoring:**\nThe closer the identical objects are in both grids, the more points you get. Penalties reduce your points. Can you beat the record?\n                           \n**Grid:**\nWhen moving an object, make sure the target spot is empty! Otherwise, you will be penalized.\nHere is your grid:\n```\n    12345\n   ╔═══╤═╗\n 1 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n 2 ║B◌◌│◌║\n 3 ║D◌◌│M║\n 4 ║◌◌U│◌║\n 5 ║◌◌◌│◌║\n   ╚═══╧═╝\n```\n\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n\n* Each message must only contain exactly one command of the type `say(MESSAGE)` or `move(ID, X, Y)`, and nothing else!\n* You must not use the words 'row' or 'column', or any numbers or coordinates in messages to the other player\n* The other player can't see your grid, and the only way you can communicate with them is by using the command `say(MESSAGE)`!\n\nPlease send a message to the other player to start the game!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "say(Hello!
